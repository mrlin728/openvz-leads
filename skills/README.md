# Skills

Skills are editable Markdown files that give OpenVZ Leads foundational sales knowledge. Each agent loads the skills it needs before making decisions.

## How Skills Work

When an agent runs, it calls `brain.load_skills_for_agent("agent_name")` which concatenates the relevant skill files and injects them into the prompt. This means you can change OpenVZ Leads' behavior by editing these files — no code changes needed.
