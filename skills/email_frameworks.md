# Cold Email Copywriting

## The Only Rule That Matters

Write like a real person sending a real email. Not a marketer. Not AI. A human who noticed something, has a thought, and is reaching out. If you read the email out loud and it sounds like a sales pitch, delete it and start over.

---

## Compliance & Deliverability (Overrides Everything Below)

Style rules are negotiable. These are not:

- **Subject lines must be truthful.** No "re:" on a thread that doesn't exist, no fake forwards ("fwd:"), no implying a prior relationship. Deceptive subject lines violate CAN-SPAM. (A follow-up sent *into a real thread* legitimately carries `Re:` — that is a genuine reply to a message that was genuinely sent. The prohibition is on faking the history, not on having one.)
- **Identity must be real.** The from-name, company, and signature must match the configured persona. Never pose as an individual consumer, a customer, or a mutual contact.
- **Every campaign needs a working opt-out and a real postal address**, and *who supplies them depends on the channel*:
  - `provider: instantly` — the platform does it. Unsubscribe handling must be enabled there, and the address set in the campaign footer.
  - `provider: gmail` — nothing else will. Gmail is a mailbox, not a sending platform. OpenVZ Leads appends the footer itself from `channels.email.gmail.footer`, and refuses to send at all while `postal_address` is empty. The opt-out mechanism is a reply, which is real because any refusal is honoured immediately and permanently — see the next point.
  - Either way: never write copy that discourages opting out, and never write your own footer into the body. Duplicating it is how one of the two ends up stale.
- **Any opt-out wording counts.** "Stop", "remove me", "not interested, don't email again" — treat all of them as unsubscribes, immediately and permanently, even mid-conversation.
- **Deliverability hygiene:** plain text only, at most one link per email (zero in email 1 is better), no attachments, no image pixels beyond what the platform adds, no ALL-CAPS or spam-trigger phrasing ("free money", "act now", "guarantee"). One recipient's spam report costs more than a hundred sends earn.
- **On Gmail, volume is the whole risk.** A sending platform warms domains and rotates inboxes; a personal mailbox does neither. A mailbox that sends fifty cold emails on its first day is a mailbox Google rate-limits, and the account it limits is the one the user reads their real mail in. Start `max_daily_sends` low — ten or twenty — and raise it over weeks, not days.
- **EU/UK prospects:** B2B cold email requires a defensible legitimate-interest basis — the pitch must be genuinely relevant to the person's professional role, and the first email should make it easy to object. When relevance is a stretch, don't send.

## What Makes Bad Cold Email (NEVER DO THESE)

### Banned Patterns
- **Em dashes (—)**: Dead giveaway of AI writing. Never use them. Use periods, commas, or line breaks instead.
- **"Picture this"**: Delete on sight.
- **"Here's what I keep seeing/hearing"**: Lazy framing. Be specific or don't say it.
- **Before/After lists**: Overdone. Everyone does this. It screams template.
- **Feature dumps**: Listing 3+ features in one email. Pick ONE thing.
- **"Worth a quick look/chat/call?"**: Vague, overused, easy to ignore.
- **"I hope this finds you well"**: Obviously.
- **"Just following up"**: Say something new or don't email.
- **"I'd love to"**: Self-serving framing. Nobody cares what you'd love.
- **Bullet points in cold email**: Real emails don't have formatted bullets.
- **"In today's [anything]"**: Filler.
- **"Imagine if"**: Don't tell them to imagine. Show them.
- **"What if I told you"**: Infomercial energy.
- **"Game-changer/revolutionary/cutting-edge"**: Meaningless hype words.
- **"Let me know if you're interested"**: Passive. No clear next step.
- **"Are you the right person?"**: Weak opener.
- **Multiple questions in one email**: Pick one.
- **Starting with "I" or "We"**: Start with them, not yourself.
- **Exclamation marks**: One max per entire sequence. Zero is better.
- **"Reaching out because"**: Just say the thing.
- **"Wanted to" / "Just wanted to"**: Weak, tentative. Say it directly.
- **Parenthetical asides (like this)**: Adds clutter. Cut them.
- **"No pressure" / "No obligation"**: Drawing attention to pressure.

### Banned Formatting
- No bold text in cold emails
- No italics
- No bullet points or numbered lists
- No headers or sections
- No horizontal rules
- No blockquotes
- Keep it plain text. Real emails are plain text.

## What Makes Good Cold Email

### It's short.
Under 75 words for email 1. Under 60 for emails 2 and 3. Count them. If you're over, cut.

### It sounds like a person.
Read it out loud. Does it sound like something you'd actually type to someone? Or does it sound like marketing copy? If it's the latter, rewrite.

### It makes one point.
Not three. Not five. One observation, one idea, one question. That's the whole email.

### It's about them.
The prospect's name, company, or situation should appear before your product does. Ideally your product isn't even named in email 1.

### It earns a reply, not a sale.
The goal of a cold email is to start a conversation. That's it. You are not closing a deal in an email. You're not even pitching. You're opening a door.

## The 3-Email Sequence

### Email 1: The Observation

Start with something you noticed about them or their business. Not a compliment (those feel fake at scale). An observation that shows you actually looked.

Then connect that observation to a problem or opportunity. Don't name your product. Don't list features. Just ask a question that makes them think.

**Structure:**
1. One line about something specific to them or their company (2 sentences max)
2. One line connecting it to a problem or gap (1 sentence)
3. One question (not "worth a call?" but something they'd actually want to answer)

**Good example:**
```
Subject: {{company}} website

{{first_name}}, looked at {{company}}'s site. You're clearly doing good work but the site probably isn't converting the way it should given how strong your reviews are.

Curious how you're currently getting leads beyond word of mouth?
```

**Bad example:**
```
Subject: {{first_name}}, quick question about {{company}}'s growth

Been looking at {{company}} — you've clearly built something real. Solid reputation.

Here's what I keep seeing though: great companies with websites that don't convert and no system to catch leads.

Picture this — a website built specifically for your industry that converts visitors, plus an AI agent that answers calls 24/7.

Worth a quick look?
```

The good one sounds like a person. The bad one sounds like ChatGPT. The difference is: specificity over generality, one idea over many, a real question over a vague CTA.

### Email 2: The Angle

Take a completely different angle from email 1. Don't reference email 1. Don't say "following up." New thread, new idea.

Pick one specific pain point and poke at it. Use a real stat if you have one, but don't stack multiple stats. End with a slightly more direct question or a one-line value statement.

**Structure:**
1. One specific problem stated plainly (1-2 sentences)
2. One stat or cost that makes it real (1 sentence, optional)
3. One line about how you solve that specific thing (1 sentence)
4. A direct question (1 sentence)

**Good example:**
```
Subject: missed calls

{{first_name}}, the average contractor misses over half their inbound calls. Every one of those is a job that goes to whoever picks up the phone first.

We built something that answers every call for companies like {{company}} and books the appointment automatically.

How are you handling after-hours calls right now?
```

### Email 3: The Breakup

Short. Respectful. Creates a tiny bit of FOMO without being manipulative. Under 40 words if possible.

Don't pitch. Don't summarize your product. Don't list what they're missing. Just close the loop like a normal human would.

**Structure:**
1. One sentence acknowledging they're busy or it's not the right time
2. One sentence leaving the door open
3. Optional: one genuinely human line (not fake warmth)

**Good example:**
```
Subject: closing the loop

{{first_name}}, sounds like the timing isn't right. Totally get it.

If this ever becomes a priority, I'm around.
```

**Bad example:**
```
Subject: last one from me

{{first_name}}, not trying to flood your inbox. Just know that {{company}} is probably losing 5-10+ leads a month to missed calls and an underperforming website.

If upgrading your online presence and lead capture is ever a priority, I'll be here.

Hope storm season treats you well.
```

The bad one is still pitching in the breakup. "Probably losing 5-10+ leads" is a guilt trip disguised as a breakup. "Hope storm season treats you well" is fake rapport. Just close the loop cleanly.

---

## Why Replies Actually Happen (Use This When Choosing an Angle)

A cold email gets a reply when it hits one of four triggers. Every email should be built around exactly one:

1. **Recognition** — you named a problem they're living with, in their own words. This is the strongest trigger. It requires real specificity: "your pricing page has four tiers but no annual option" beats "companies struggle with pricing" every time.
2. **Curiosity gap** — you know something they'd want to know ("noticed something odd in how {{company}} shows up in search"). Only works if you actually deliver the payoff when they reply. Never manufacture a fake gap.
3. **Easy yes** — the ask is so small that replying is cheaper than deleting ("is this on your radar at all?" beats "do you have 30 minutes Thursday?").
4. **Status/peer proof** — a named, real peer or competitor did something relevant. Must be true and public. "Two roofing companies in Austin started doing X" only if they exist.

If the draft doesn't clearly hit one of these, it will be ignored no matter how clean the copy is. Rewrite around a trigger, not around your product.

## Subject Lines

### Rules
- Always lowercase
- 2-5 words max
- Never include the prospect's name in the subject
- Never use "quick question" (overused beyond recognition)
- Should look like an internal email, not a marketing email
- "re:" is only allowed when the email genuinely continues an earlier thread in the same sequence — never as a fake-reply trick on a fresh thread
- Emails 2 and 3 in a sequence should usually take a completely new subject (new angle, new thread)

### Good subjects
- `{{company}} website`
- `missed calls`
- `thought about {{company}}`
- `one thing`
- `your lead flow`
- `closing the loop`
- `{{company}} + [your product area]`

### Bad subjects
- `{{first_name}}, quick question about {{company}}'s growth`
- `transform your business with AI`
- `exclusive offer for {{company}}`
- `3 ways to boost your leads`
- `I'd love to connect`
- `following up on my last email`

---

## Campaign Variety

When writing multiple campaigns for different angles, each campaign MUST feel completely different. Not just different pain points with the same structure. Different:

- **Tone**: One could be more direct, another more curious, another more data-driven
- **Length**: One campaign could have ultra-short emails, another slightly longer ones
- **Angle**: Don't just swap out which feature you mention. Change the entire frame. One campaign might focus on cost, another on a specific workflow problem, another on what competitors are doing.
- **Structure**: Don't always open with an observation. Sometimes open with a question. Sometimes open with a stat. Sometimes open with one bold claim.

If all three campaigns read like they were written by the same template with different variables swapped in, they're bad. Rewrite them.

---

## Personalization That Actually Works

### Good personalization
- Reference their specific product, service, or market
- Mention something visible on their website (not just "I looked at your site")
- Reference their city, region, or local market
- Mention a specific challenge their industry faces right now

### Bad personalization
- "You've clearly built something real" (empty flattery)
- "Solid reputation in your market" (means nothing)
- "Companies like yours" (vague)
- "As a {{title}}" (obvious merge tag)

---

## Tone Calibration

### Default tone
Conversational, direct, helpful. Like a peer reaching out, not a vendor pitching. Write at a 7th grade reading level. Short sentences. Simple words.

### Adjustments by prospect
- **C-suite**: Even shorter. Get to the point faster. Respect their time explicitly.
- **Technical roles**: Be specific about the problem. Skip the emotional language.
- **Small business owners**: Be warm but not salesy. They get pitched constantly and hate it.
- **Enterprise**: More professional, but still human. Don't over-formalize.

---

## The Test

Before finalizing any email, ask:

1. Could a real person have written this? (not "could AI have written this to sound human")
2. Is there exactly one idea in this email?
3. Is it under 75 words?
4. Would I reply to this if I received it?
5. Does it contain any em dashes?
6. Does it contain any of the banned patterns listed above?
7. Is every factual claim in it true and sourced from product_knowledge.md or the prospect's own site?
8. Is the subject line honest, and the identity the real configured persona?

If the answer to #5 or #6 is yes, or #7 or #8 is no, rewrite it. No exceptions.
